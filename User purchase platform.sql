-- Question 113
-- Table: Spending

-- +-------------+---------+
-- | Column Name | Type    |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | user_id     | int     |
-- | spend_date  | date    |
-- | platform    | enum    | 
-- | amount      | int     |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- The table logs the spendings history of users that make purchases from an online shopping website which has a desktop and a mobile application.
-- (user_id, spend_date, platform) is the primary key of this table.
-- The platform column is an ENUM type of ('desktop', 'mobile').
-- Write an SQL query to find the total number of users and the total amount spent using mobile only, desktop only and both mobile and desktop together for each date.

-- The query result format is in the following example:

-- Spending table:
-- +---------+------------+----------+--------+
-- | user_id | spend_date | platform | amount |
-- +---------+------------+----------+--------+
-- | 1       | 2019-07-01 | mobile   | 100    |
-- | 1       | 2019-07-01 | desktop  | 100    |
-- | 2       | 2019-07-01 | mobile   | 100    |
-- | 2       | 2019-07-02 | mobile   | 100    |
-- | 3       | 2019-07-01 | desktop  | 100    |
-- | 3       | 2019-07-02 | desktop  | 100    |
-- +---------+------------+----------+--------+

-- Result table:
-- +------------+----------+--------------+-------------+
-- | spend_date | platform | total_amount | total_users |
-- +------------+----------+--------------+-------------+
-- | 2019-07-01 | desktop  | 100          | 1           |
-- | 2019-07-01 | mobile   | 100          | 1           |
-- | 2019-07-01 | both     | 200          | 1           |
-- | 2019-07-02 | desktop  | 100          | 1           |
-- | 2019-07-02 | mobile   | 100          | 1           |
-- | 2019-07-02 | both     | 0            | 0           |
-- +------------+----------+--------------+-------------+ 
-- On 2019-07-01, user 1 purchased using both desktop and mobile, user 2 purchased using mobile only and user 3 purchased using desktop only.
-- On 2019-07-02, user 2 purchased using mobile only, user 3 purchased using desktop only and no one purchased using both platforms.

-- Solution
with recursive t1 as (
select spend_date, 
case when total_users = 2 then 'both'
when total_users = 1 then platform end platform, total_users , amount
from 
(select sum(amount) as amount ,platform,user_id, spend_date,count(platform) as total_users
from spending
group by user_id,spend_date
order by spend_date) as s
),

select distinct s1.spend_date,s2.platform 
from spending s1,(select distinct platform
from t1) as s2)
select t2.spend_date, t2.platform,coalesce(t1.amount,0) as total_amount, 
coalesce(total_users,0) as total_users
from t2 left join t1
on t1.spend_date = t2.spend_date
and t1.platform = t2.platform
order by t2.spend_date,t2.platform desc;
